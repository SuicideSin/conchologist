Tired of your shells not having history?

Tired of having multiple netcat listeners on your attack box?

Every wanted to share your shells with your script kiddie friends?

Then you should try cc_handler!

Notes:
- Name is a work in progress...
- Currently doesn't remove old sessions (not sure if I want to implement this...they aren't kept on the server, but clients keep them locally...).
